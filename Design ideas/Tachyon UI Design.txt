Header of page says Tachyon in some nice styling and letter spacing. Will have form underneath to input a url and a checkbox next to it to display as mobile page

 each grid box has a title, an image, and a Performance: Loading... and Accessibility: Loading... area. "Loading..." strings will become percentages.

  If page is mobile, will display mobile underneath title
